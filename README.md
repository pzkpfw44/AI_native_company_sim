AI-Native Company Simulation

Overview

The AI-Native Company Simulation models an AI-driven enterprise where artificial intelligence makes strategic business decisions, adapts to market fluctuations, and manages financial resources. The goal is to explore how AI can optimize business processes, allocate resources, and respond to economic conditions dynamically.
This is still a first testing version upon with additional builds will take place.

Features

AI-Driven Decision Making: AI autonomously selects between HR investment, R&D, marketing, or cost-cutting strategies.

Market Simulation: Randomized market fluctuations impact company revenue and strategic choices.

Financial Tracking: Tracks balance, revenue impact, and decision history over time.

Performance Analysis: Outputs a history of AI decisions and their financial impact for post-analysis.

Technologies Used

Python: Core programming language

Pandas: Data handling and analysis

Random: Market trend and decision simulation

Datetime: Time tracking for decision history

Installation

Clone this repository:

git clone https://github.com/yourusername/ai-native-company-simulation.git
cd ai-native-company-simulation

Install dependencies:

pip install pandas

Run the simulation:

python ai_simulation.py

How It Works

The AI makes a strategic decision in each simulation step.

The market fluctuates randomly, affecting the company's financial health.

The company's financial balance updates based on AI decisions and market conditions.

A history log is maintained for review and analysis.

Example Output

Market: 1.12 | AI Decision: R&D | Impact: $75000.00 | Balance: $1075000.00
Market: 0.95 | AI Decision: Marketing | Impact: -$25000.00 | Balance: $1050000.00
